    <h2> William Shakespeare </h2>
    
    
    <div>
            <P>Love is a theme that is explored in literature across different time periods and genres, with varying interpretations of its nature and effects. 
            William Shakespeare in his sonnet 116 “Let me not to the Marriage of True Minds” describes love as eternal and unchanging, enduring even in the face of time and hardship. In contrast, William Faulkner in his short story “A Rose for Emily” explores love through the life of Emily Grierson. 
            He shows the dark side of love and says love is decaying, destructive and obsessive.  Shakespeare idealizes love as an unbreakable force that transcends time, Faulkner challenges this notion by portraying love as something that worsens when entangled with obsession and dear of change.
            While both texts explore love and time, Faulkner presents love as destructive, distorted by control and decaying whereas Shakespeare idealizes love as unwavering and eternal.
            Both Faulkner and Shakespeare make a distinct argument about the nature of love and its relationship with time. “Loves not Time’s fool, though rosy lips and cheeks.
            Within his bending sickle’s compass come” (Shakespeare 10). This metaphor suggests that while physical beauty fades with age, true love remains constant and unaltered.</p>
         
         
            <p> Love remains constant despite life’s challenges and even in the face of death. However, he asserts that love is impervious to these forces, reinforcing the idea that love is an eternal, guiding force. 
            Faulkner on the other hand demonstrates how time erodes both love and life. He presents a vision of love that does not triumph over time but instead deteriorates under its weight.
            Emily Grierson clings to the past, resisting the passage of time, just as she later refuses to let go of Homer Barron. 
            This isolates Emily from the world. Her denial of reality is evident when Faulkner writes “She told them the father was not dead. 
            She did that for three days, with the ministers calling on her, and the doctors, trying to persuade her to let them dispose of the body” (Faulkner 3). 
            Unlike Shakespeare vision of love triumphing over time, Faulkner’s story shows that love can become stagnant and ruinous when one refuses to accept change.
            Shakespeare further reinforces his view of love as an unbearable force in the lines “Love alters not with his brief hours and weeks but bears it out even to the edge of the doom” (Shakespeare 11-12). 
            This shows that Shakespeare thinks that love is a guiding eternal force that does not change with circumstances. 
            Here, Shakespeare argues that true love remains steadfast regardless of external circumstances.
            By stating that love persists “to the edge of doom”, (Shakespeare 11-12) he implies that love endures even in the face of death and adversity. 
            Love is portrayed as an enduring force that remains strong despite the time and adversity.
            According to Shakespeare, real love is selfless and does not change based on external factors. 
            In contrast, Faulkner presents a darker more tragic view of love in A Rose for Emily. 
            “We did not say she was crazy then. We believed she had to do that. We remembered all the young men her father had driven away” (Faulkner 1). 
            This suggests that Emily’s upbringing conditioned her to see love as something that must be possessed and controlled, rather than freely given and received.</p>
